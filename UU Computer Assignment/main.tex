\section{Assignment 1 (Theoretical distributions)}
\subsection{Distributions and parameters}
Because the random sample of n independent observations $\; X_i$, $  i=1,2,...,n $ are from a population that follows a  $N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ distribution, where $\mu = 0 $ 
and $ \sigma^2 = 1$. 
So that the distribution of $\;Z_1, Z_2, Z_3, Z_4, and \;Z_5 $ are:
\vskip 0.5cm
According to THEOREM 7.1 (pg.353, Wackerly, endenhall, and Scheaffer) , we can know that, $Z_1$ is normally distributed with mean $\mu_{Z1}=0$ and variance $\sigma^2_{Z1}=\frac{1}{n}$ .
\vskip 0.5cm
$Z_1 = \overline{X} 
\sim N(0,\frac{1}{n}) $

\vskip 0.5cm
According to THEOREM 7.3 (pg.357, Wackerly, endenhall, and Scheaffer) , we can know that, $Z_2$ has a $\chi^2$ distribution with (n-1) degrees of freedom (df).

\vskip 0.5cm
$
Z_2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_{i}-\overline{X})^2}{\sigma^2}
\sim \chi^2(n-1)
$
\vskip 0.5cm
According to THEOREM 7.2 (pg.356, Wackerly, endenhall, and Scheaffer) , we can know that, $Z_3$ has a $\chi^2$ distribution with n degrees of freedom (df).
\vskip 0.5cm
$
Z_3 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i-\mu)^2}{\sigma^2}
\sim \chi^2(n) 
$
\vskip 0.5cm
Notice that the top part of the equation is the same equation as the normal distribution equation($Z_1$), and the lower part of the equation is a $\chi^2$ distribution. According to DEFINITION 7.2 (pg.360, Wackerly, endenhall, and Scheaffer) , we can know that, $Z_4$ has a t distribution with (n-1) degrees of freedom (df).
\vskip 0.5cm
$
Z_4 = \frac{\frac{\overline{X}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}}{\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i-\overline{X})^2}{(n-1)\sigma^2}}}
\sim  t(n-1)
$
\vskip 0.5cm
Notice that the top part and the lower part of the equation are independent $\chi^2$ distributed random variables with n and m df, respectively. According to DEFINITION 7.3 (pg.362, Wackerly, endenhall, and Scheaffer) , we can know that, $Z_5$ has an F distribution with n numerator degrees of freedom and m denominator degrees of freedom.
\vskip 0.5cm
$
Z_5 = \frac{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i-\overline{X})^2}{(n-1)\sigma^2}}{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i-\overline{Y})^2}{(m-1)\sigma^2}}
\sim F(n-1,m-1) 
$

\subsection{Formula of the expected value, variance, and standard deviation}
According to 1.1, we can know that the formulas for the statisticâ€™s expected value, variance, its standard deviation are:
\vskip 0.5cm
$E(Z_1) = \mu = 0 \;\;
Var(Z_1) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n} = \frac{1}{n}   \;\;\;\;
sd(Z_1) = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}
$
\vskip 0.5cm
$E(Z_2) = n-1  \;\;
Var(Z_2) = 2(n-1)  \;\;\;
sd(Z_2) = \sqrt{2(n-1)}  \;\;
$
\vskip 0.5cm
$E(Z_3) = n  \;\qquad
Var(Z_3) = 2n  \;\;\;\;\;\qquad
sd(Z_3) = \sqrt{2n} 
$
\vskip 0.5cm
$E(Z_4) = 0 \;\;\qquad
Var(Z_4) = \frac{n}{n-2}\;\;\;\qquad
sd(Z_4) = \sqrt{\frac{n}{n-2}}
$
\vskip 0.5cm
$E(Z_5) = \frac{m-1}{m-3}\;\quad
Var(Z_5) = \frac{2(m-1)^2(m+n-4)}{(n-1)(m-3)^2(m-5)}\;\;
sd(Z_5) = \sqrt{\frac{2(m-1)^2(m+n-4)}{(n-1)(m-3)^2(m-5)}}\;\;
$

\section{Assignment 2 (Empirical distributions)}
\subsection{Statistics $Z_1, Z_2, Z_3$ and $Z_4$}
Draw 1000 samples of size n = 5 and n = 20 from the population. Based on these samples, evaluate all four statistics.

When $n = 5$,  the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the 1000 samples the for the statistics $Z_1$ to $Z_4$ are listed in Table 4.  According to the Table 4, for each of the four statistics, the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the 1000 samples are approximately equal to  the theoretical values.

As the graphs show, the empirical distribution of $Z_1$ basically fits the theoretical distribution, a normal distribution where the expected value is 0 and the variance is $\frac{1}{5}$, with a certain amount of error.

The empirical distribution of $Z_2$ basically fits the theoretical distribution, a chi-square distribution where the degree of freedom is 4, with a certain amount of error.

The empirical distribution of $Z_3$ basically fits the theoretical distribution, a chi-square distribution where the degree of freedom is 5, with a certain amount of error.

The empirical distribution of $Z_4$ basically fits the theoretical distribution, a t-distribution where the parameter is 4, with a certain amount of error.

The reason why we can see that the empirical distributions do not fit the theoretical distribution really well is that the samples are random and the samples size is not big enough. If we increase the number of samples, the result will fit better.
